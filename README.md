# horizon game engine
engine for devpty games, made in 99.9% rust and 0.1% shell.
this is our main project currently. the engine will be used for most if not all of our upcoming (usually 2d) games
- will include development tools so you can create levels without manually inputting data lol
- will be less meme-y once we reach somewhere close to functionality
- repo is public now because we honestly do not care about other people seeing our progress
