# Horizon Game Engine
engine for devpty games, made in 99.9% rust and 0.1% shell
this is our main project currently. the engine will be used for most if not all of our upcoming (2d) games

will include development tools so you can create levels without manually inputting data lol

will be less meme-y once we reach somewhere close to functionality
