# horizon and horizon projects style guide

we follow the official rust style guide except with a few modifications:

- use tabs for initial indentation, but spaces after the first character
- don't align multi-line arguments, have them all indented one level
- aligning things after the first character is preferred if it increases readability
- doc-strings don't have to contain full sentences unless they're public and in a release


for now this formatting must be considered manually, eventually a rustfmt configuration file will be provided
