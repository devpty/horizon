#!/usr/bin/env bash
## this script starts a crate binary from the root dir
## there are a few ways to do it though

## the intended way
cargo run -p $1

## the cool wayâ„¢
## this puts the cwd inside the project when it runs it
## however, this creates a lot of cache duplication (each folder gets it's
##                                                   own cargo target folder)
# cd $1 && RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run
